A Warning on the Dangers of Honeypots,129,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueMidterm2018/comments/9nzhvl/a_warning_on_the_dangers_of_honeypots/,23,1539513422.0,"Just a friendly reminder for everyone that things aren't always as they seem. Right-wing trolls occasionally make sites called ""honeypots"" that masquerade as left-wing ""resistance"" websites in order to collect the information of those who visit. Our friends on That Other Sub are trying to make one of these sites, called the National Progressive Coalition (or NPC, a reference to one of their stupid memes). Please be on the lookout, and please stick to reputable sites and sources.

Thank you!"

A little feel good story from Massachusetts,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueMidterm2018/comments/9nz33u/a_little_feel_good_story_from_massachusetts/,15,1539509375.0,"So MA as you may have guessed is a blue state, quite possibly the bluest. (Prove me wrong)  but some areas in Massachusetts are less blue than others.  Case in point, the Bristol area.  Despite electing Paul feeney the area that inhabits my college is pretty light blue.  There were even some Diehl signs (only 2) but still.   So naturally I expect maybe a couple of signs because MA is blue as is.  And I found the entire highway, streets, and sidewalks of attlerburro covered in a metric fuckton of state dem rep signs.  like it was unbelievable it was a goddamn Forrest of pro democrat signs in an area that is kinda trumpy if you look beneath the cracks.  You would think that MA would say ‚Äúfuck it our state is already blue we don‚Äôt need to try hard.‚Äù But no! It‚Äôs aggressively pro dem.  I even remember talking to a guy from Attleboro watching the tv and he told me. What do you think trump? I said fuck him and he said no no no kid.  If your gonna be liberal here you gotta be a super liberal.  Call him gahbage and piss on the diehl sign with me.  I skipped his later offer but I did call trump gahbage.  Wonder if he went through with pissing on the diehl sign?"

Should I catalogue which districts/states could most effectively use donations?,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueMidterm2018/comments/9nvqj6/should_i_catalogue_which_districtsstates_could/,2,1539482273.0,"Hey guys, so I noticed how Texas senate candidate Beto O'Rourke has raised an astounding $38 million for his Senate campaign.

Although this is a huge milestone and we should all be happy about it, I'm an avid follower of 538 and I know from their commentary that at a certain point, fundraising brings in marginal returns. Although every dollar helps, sometimes your one dollar is more effectively spent in one region compared to another.

So for example, Senate candidate Jacky Rosen in Nevada has raised more than 9 million, more than incumbent Dean Heller, but she still has less cash on hand for him. If you have a dollar to donate, it would be better served donated to her as it would create higher incremental returns.

I feel like other resources have probably done this already, but if not I have to ask; should I try and catalogue which Senate and Representative could most effectively use your donations, in a chart that combines their likelihood of winning regardless of fundraising (using polling and expert ratings) and their current fundraising totals?"

Before we begin with today, how did Gretchen Whitmer, Karl Dean, and Jared Henderson do in yesterday's debates? Any breakthroughs that they made? Were there any gaffes that should be avoided in the future? If so, post it!  

Today's races features a variety of races, as debates are held for a U.S. Senate race, a gubernatorial race, and a Congressional race.  

Wisconsin U.S. Senate Debate (Tammy Baldwin vs. Leah Vukmir):  
Sponsor: Wisconsin Broadcasters Association  
Time: 8:00 PM EDT  
Importance: This is a likely D race, which means we can't entirely let down our guard there. Also, Tony Evers could really use Baldwin's coattails in order to defeat the reprehensible Scott Walker!

Idaho Gubernatorial Debate (Paulette Jordan vs. Brad Little):  
Sponsor: KBOI

Florida's 27th Congressional District Debate (Donna Shalala vs. 	Maria Elvira Salazar):  
Sponsor: Telemundo 51  
Time: 1:00 PM EDT
